        <h1>Target Audience:</h1>
        <p>The target audience for this site is those
        living in or planning to travel to Preston, Soda Springs or
        Fish Haven. It will most likely be adults who have children
        and older individuals who check this site on a daily basis.</p>
        <h2>Two Personas</h2>
        <p>Persona 1: Your Average soccer mom: Everyday is a whole new
        adventure this mom. Getting all the kids up dressed, lunches
        packed, and in the car on the way to school is quite the task
        and achievement. This mom needs a reliable site to make sure
        she gets her kids ready for the elements that lie outside.</p>
        <p>Persona 2: Active retired couple: These two are living life
        to the fullest. Now that they are retired each new day has
        something to offer. Whether that be Pickleball at the park
        with friends, or relaxing by the pool. These two have endless
        options to choose from. Knowing an accurate forcast is
        essential for a productive retired life. Having an accurate
        weekend forecast is a must have for this audience. If they
        miss out on a weekend getaway because of a false weather
        report, you can bet they will not be revisiting your site.</p>

            friends are contemplating taking the motorcycles out for
